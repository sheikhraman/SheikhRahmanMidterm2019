Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. A data structure is a specialize fromat for organising and storing data. general datat structure types include the
array, the file, the record,the tree, and so on, . any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that
it can be accessed and worked  with in appropriate ways.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Traversing searching, inserting deleting, sorting, and merging.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Data structire are mostly used in Database management system , compiler design , operating system, statistical analysis package, numerical analysis, graphics
,Artificial Intelligence and simulation.
what is an Array?
A. An array is a data structure that stores a collection of value of the same type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. the main difference with Array and ArrayList is , in Array the array size is static is nature. That means its lenght is fixed. we can't change its size once
it is created. On the other hand Arraylist is dynamic in nature. ArrayList is also called as dynamic array or because, it automatically resizes itself if we
try to add elements beyond its capacity.
what is LinkedList?
A. LinkedList is a linear data structure where each  elements beyonds its capacity. Array users length function and arraylist users size.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. In array each elements is independent, not connection with previous element or with its location. in Linked list location or address of elements is stored in the link
part of previous element/node . In array , no pointers are used linked are like kinked list so no need of extra space in memory of pointer.
what is queue?
A. A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the que , and elements remove from the beginnig of the quee . queue flows first in first out principle.
what is stack?
A. It is a data structure that allows datat to be inserted and removed. Stack flows last in first out . therefore last data to be inserted will be first
data to be moved.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO: First in First Out
LiFO: Last in First out.
what is the order of complexity?
A. It is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input and the algorithm finishes between tow factors of it. Generally , the smaller the order of
complexicity of the program's under lying algorithm the faster it will run and the better it will scale.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. Binary search
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. Hypothetical data set.
what is tree in data structure?
A. Tree represents the nodes connected by edges.
what is graph in data structure?
A.A graph structure is set of items connected by edges. Each item is called a vertex or node. A graph is a set of vertices and a binary relation between vertices
adjacency.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. HashTable is  a synchronize whereas hashMap is not synchronized. HashTable does not allows null keys or values whereas HasMap allows null keys;
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS user array. Network data model users grpahs and Hierarchical data model uses Tree.
How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap works on the princpal of hashing.HashMap stores both key and value object, in bucket , as an object of Entry class which implement
HashMap provides put (key value) for storing ad get(key) method for retriving values from HashMap.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException is a runtime exception throws only at runtime. it occurs when java program tries to access an invalid index, mean an index which
is not psoitive or greater than the lenght of an array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Arrys inherit methods fro object class, and clone is one of them.
Object.clone();
Object.CopyOf();
Arrays.CopyOff();
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. In array , each element is independent , not connection with previous  element or with its location. in linked list, location or address of elements is
stored in the link part of previous element/node. in Array, no pointers are used like linked list s no need of extra space in memory for pointer.
What is DFS and BFS?
A. Depth first search: DfS is a method for exploring  a tree or graph in a DFS we go as deep as possible down one path
before backing up and trying a different one. Here DFS explore one path , hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one.
Breaddth first Search: BFS is a method for exploring a tree graph. in a BFS we first explore all the nodes one step away , then all
the nodes two steps away and so on. BFS traverse the tree starting with root.
What is Recursion?
A.Recursion in Java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously.A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Linear data structures are Array, stack, Queue , linkedList , no liner data structures are trees and graphs.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big-(o)  nation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big(0) specifically describe the worst case scenario, and can be used
to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.Insertion sort,selection sort,mergesort, Heapsort, quick sort, shell short, bucket sort.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
